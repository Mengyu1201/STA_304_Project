# This is the brief summary of this project. 
# Systolic blood pressure has been identified to be related to smoking status. However, the risk factors associated with systolic blood pressure are not fully identified and evaluated. The primary objective of this project is to identify a set of risk factors for systolic blood pressure given the exposure of smoking status. By utilizing the NHANES data and stratified random sampling procedure, gender, age, diastolic blood pressure, and marital status have been found to be positively correlated with systolic blood pressure. While the household income is negatively associated with systolic blood pressure. The findings could potentially help clinicians to identify high-risk subjects with higher systolic blood pressure and provide personalized treatment suggestion accordingly.
